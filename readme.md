# Custom bibliography style for biblatex
This custom style was recommended to be used in presentations.


## Installation 

You should have a local `texmf`. If you know where it is this is what you do
```bash
texmf/tex/latex/biblatex/bbx # this is where .bbx goes
texmf/tex/latex/biblatex/cbx # this is where .cbx goes
```

## Other
The `bbx` file controls listing of references. The `cbx` file specifies how
citations look like.
